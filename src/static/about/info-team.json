        "intro": "Phabase is a public genomic database dedicated to Phaseolus spp., particularly to black bean Phaseolus vulgaris var. Negro Jamapa, an important crop in Mexico. The project offers access to high-quality genomic data, interactive tools for exploration and comparison, and integration with genome browsers and BLAST search functionality. Additionally, this platform offers a gene expression atlas, which integrates available transcriptome data from diferentes órganos y tejidos de P. vulgaris bajo distintas condiciones.",
